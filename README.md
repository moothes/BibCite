# BibCite
BibCite is a visual editor for LaTeX ``.bib`` files.  
Though we currently have a preliminary version with minimal features, we are committed to building a more powerful and user-friendly tool.  
We have a long way to go, and we're excited about the journey ahead.  
Your feedback on our initial version is invaluable as we work to shape the tool's development.  
We welcome any suggestions or contributions, please don't hesitate to contact us at ``csehjzhou@ust.hk``.

3. Right click the entry to edit or remove.
